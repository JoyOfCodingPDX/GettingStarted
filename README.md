# Getting Started with Advanced Programming with Java

This repository helps students in Advanced Programming with Java get
started with the programming assignments.  Most noteably, it makes it
so students do not need install [Apache
Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) on their local machines
(or the PSU machines) in order to create and build the programmming
projects.  It makes liberal use of the [Maven
Wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper) script which
automatically downloads and installs the version of Maven needed for
the programming projects..

## How do I use this repository?

## How can I improve this repository?

This repository is kind of thrown together and it ought to evolve to
meet the needs of the students who take Advanced Programming with
Java.  

Feel free to [create issues](/issues) for this repository if you find
something missing or confusing.

It's even better, though, when someone contribute their own changes
(add new scripts, augment documentation, fix type-os, etc.), to this
repository.  Please make a (public)
[fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) of this
repository in GitHub, make your changes in a branch of that
repository, and [create a pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
against this repository.  We can then have a discussion about your
changes via GitHub.
